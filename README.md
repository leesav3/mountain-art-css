# mountain-art-css

## CSS art!

### The Challenge
This is a project inspired by a freeCodeCamp project 'Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting'. A few weeks ago I was at a flea market and saw a piece of art made out of strips of wood made to look like a mountain, so I figured I'd try to recreate that. It was not easy!

### My Process
* Built with HTML `<div>`'s and CSS
  
### What I Learned
A lot! I started out trying to figure out how I was going to make the mitered edges on the strips of wood for the mountains. I originally tried creating a 40px border on a `<div>` and making 3 of the sides transparent. But then I couldn't figure out how to get a colored wood overlay on top of the border. So, I did a little more Googling and decided to try making a trapezoid using `clip-path` and then rotating it 45 degrees to make the mountain. It took a little math to figure out the lengths of each piece and the percentages to clip off each end.
